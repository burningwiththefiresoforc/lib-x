### Fixes 1.0  
### Changed  
-Changed script notifications from terminal notifications to notify-send for integration into dunst or other notification daemons  
-Fixed the rofi menu cutting off the exit option making it difficult to exit the menu loop  
-Added functionality for the rofi menu to pull up yazi or fzf with a terminal in a new option PREFERRED_TERMINAL when adding books. Default terminal is kitty.  
-Reordered some of the menu items  
-Made the icons more consistent  
-Spelling corrections  
-Disabled automatic updates. Seems potentially unsafe.
